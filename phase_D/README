Project Phase D 

—— PART 0: Updates From Phase C —— 
We had to update our data cleaning process because we realized that using a ‘,’ separator was causing problems for song names that name commas in them. We fixed this by using a ‘\t’ separator. We updated the scripts that generate our text files, as well as the sql setup scripts. 

Updated files (included):
preprocessing_music.py
Song.txt
SongGenre.txt
BillboardChart.txt 
setup.sql
setup-small.sql

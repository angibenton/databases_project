-- Workflow --
* download csv files from the sources above
* in a python script, open the csv files as pandas dataframes 
* manipulate these dataframes until we have a dataframe for each of our relations
@emilia should we just attach the python scripts to the submission rather than explain them here?
with good comments maybe its okay 
* save these final dataframes as .txt files, with commas separated by ',', rows by '\n'
